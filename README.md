# Frontier-Link-Scanner
-Just a thought experiment-

In a world where everyone uses frontier models; often we find ourselves looking at links they provide us. How can we ensure they aren't malicious?

Introducing a chrome extension scanner which aims to run any links that are generated through your virustotal's account via your private api key. (Links are scanned through your account, you control your data; No one else does)

The files in this repo are the files used to create this extension. (Will be updated upon completion, current state of files)

This scanner can also be applied when looking through emails. Most people don't have state of the art phishing detection on their personal inboxes. This could help prevent people from malicious actors. (finetuning this part)


# LINK SCANNER for Frontier models has been removed; Working on email link scanner portion.

Go to Virustotal -> Login -> Top right click on your name -> Click API Key -> Copy API key in Chrome Extention.

Only works for gmail inboxes for now.
