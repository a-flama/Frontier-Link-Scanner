# Frontier-Link-Scanner

In a world where everyone uses frontier models; often we find ourselves looking at links they provide us. How can we ensure they aren't malicious?

Introducing a chrome extension scanner which aims to run any links that are generated through your virustotal's account via your private api key; on a side note development of halluncinated links have also begun.

The files in this repo are the files used to create this extension. (Will be updated upon completion, current state of files)
